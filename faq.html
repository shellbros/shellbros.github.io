<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<hr><a name="issues"></a>
<h3>Are you aware of this bug?</h3>
<p>Probably. Here are some known issues we're currently battling:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Some players have invisible shells by clipping through an opject. It's a bug, NOT hackers, k?
    <li>Sometimes a difference in ping can mean people will appear to have the wrong weapon.
    <li>If you notice you are not getting Eggs for kills, please reload the page.
</ul>

<hr><a name="lag"></a>
<h3>Lag! What should I do?</h3>
<p>If your shots are getting off really late, or you're bouncing around all over the place, here are a few things you can try:
<ul>
	<li>Close any other open tabs.
    <li>Pause or cancel any active downloads or streams on your network. Turn off that cat video!
    <li>Close any file-sharing applications.
    <li>Close apps that download in the background (Steam, etc.)
    <li>Try a different server closer to your location.
    <li>Restart your router.
    <li>If you're on WiFi, try a wired connection if you can.
</ul>
<p>Generally speaking, we like to see a ping of 100ms or less. You can see your ping in the upper-right corner of the game window as you play. You can get away with higher pings if they're consistent. Lag spikes (when your ping momentarily shoots upward) will absolutely ruin your day, though, and there is unfortunately no way for the game to compensate for them.</p>

<hr><a name="slow"></a>
<h3>My frame rate is low. Now what?</h3>
<p>(Frame rate is indicated by the FPS readout in the upper-right corner of the game window. 60 is best!)</p>
<ul>
    <li>Try closing other apps, browsers, and tabs
    <li>Open Settings and turn off Auto Detail, then un-check High Resolution and Shadows (if enabled)
    <li>If you're running multiple displays, try moving your browser window to another one
    <li>Sometimes you may have accidentilly zoomed in. Try zooming out (CTLR & -) and see if it makes a difference.
    <li>Install the latest video drivers for your card. Here are some links for common brands:<br>
        <a target="_window" href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx">NVIDIA</a>&nbsp;
        <a target="_window" href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download">ATI</a>&nbsp;
        <a target="_window" href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/graphics-drivers.html">Intel</a>

    <li>If your GPU is on Chrome's blacklist, it might be using a software renderer known as "SwiftShader", which is terribly slow. Enter chrome://flags in your address bar, search for "Override software rendering list", and enable it. CAUTION: The blacklist exists for a reason. This may make your system unstable. Make sure you save anything you're working on before trying this!
</ul>
<p>If you're running Chrome, try enabling Experimental Canvas 2D API features:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Enter chrome://flags in the address bar.
    <li>Type "canvas" in the search box.
    <li>Find "Experimental Canvas 2D API features" and enable it
    <li>Restart Chrome
</ul>
<p>This may make it better, or worse. Good luck with that.</p>

<hr><a name="pointerlock"></a>
<h3>Why can't I fire?</h3>
<p>Some systems have a problem with registering trackpad taps while in Pointer Lock. A full click of the pad, while annoying, I know, should do the trick. It's an issue that's currently being looked in to.</p>

<hr><a name="palm"></a>
<h3>Why can't I move and shoot at the same time?</h3>
<p>Some systems have palm-cancelling software enabled by default, which prevents simultaneous keyboard and trackpad/mouse input. Check your system settings for palm cancelling/rejection and turn down the sensitivity or disable it altogether.</p>

<hr><a name="future"></a>
<h3>Are you going to add more (guns/maps/modes/etc)??</h3>
<h1 style="font-size: 3em;">YES!</h1>
<p>New Maps are added monthly and we are constantly looking at future awesome features! Shell Shockers is currently being developed by a small team, so it's going to take a little time. Rest assured, however, the game is in active development, and when new features are ready, you'll be the first to know!</p>


<hr><a name="proxy"></a>
<h3>Shell Shockers is blocked on my network. How do I play?</h3>
<p>No problem! Try one of our proxy domains: <a href="http://www.eggcombat.com">www.eggcombat.com</a> and get back to cracking some eggs. No fear if it's blocked too - The full list can be found on our <a href="https://discord.gg/bluewizard">Discord Server</a>

<hr><a name="webgl"></a>
<h3>How do I enable WebGL?</h3>
<p>That depends on your browser! Shell Shockers requires WebGL, so if you can play the game already, it's enabled, and you don't have to worry about this! Otherwise, follow the directions for your browser below. If your browser version is older than the one listed, download the latest! You'll thank me later.</p>
<h3>Chrome 88+</h3>
<b>Step 1 - Enable hardware acceleration</b>
<ul>
    <li>Enter <code>chrome://settings</code> in the address bar
    <li>Open the Advanced settings (probably at the bottom)
    <li>In the System section, make sure that "Use hardware acceleration when available" is checked. If not, you'll have to restart Chrome after you change it.
</ul>

<b>Step 2 - Enable WebGL</b>
<ul>
    <li>Enter <code>chrome://flags</code> in the address bar
    <li>Search for WebGL and set both options to "Enabled". Again, you'll have to restart Chrome once you've done so.
</ul>

<h3>Firefox 85+</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Enter <code>about:config</code> in the address bar
    <li>Search for webgl.disabled and make sure it's set to <code>false</code>
</ul>
<p>Changes take effect immediately.</p>
<h3>Safari 14.0.1+</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Select Safari->Preferences from the menu bar
    <li>Select the Advanced tab
    <li>Make sure that the Show Develop menu in menu bar checkbox is checked
    <li>In the Develop menu, select Experimental Features and make sure that WebGL 2.0 is checked
</ul>
<h3>Edge 84+</h3>
<p>Should be enabled by default. If not, you probably need to update your graphics driver!</p>

<h3>Internet Explorer</h3>
<p>Sorry, Shell Shockers doesn't support IE, as it's missing some key features.</p>

<hr><a name="websockets"></a>
<h3>WebSockets? Say what?</h3>
<p>WebSockets allow for efficient communication that is vital for games of this type. Here's a list of browsers that support it. If yours isn't on the list, or is older than the version shown, you should download a new one!</p>
<h3>Supported browsers</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Chrome
    <li>Firefox
    <li>Edge
    <li>Safari
    <li>Opera
    <li>Brave
</ul>

<hr><a name="system"></a>
<h3>System requirements</h3>
<p>We're still in the process of working this out, but here's a rough idea:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A mouse (or trackpad; ew!) and keyboard. No official mobile support (yet!)
    <li>2.0Ghz processor
    <li>4GB RAM
    <li>A graphics accelerator that supports WebGL
    <li>A broadband connection
    <li>A <a href="#webgl">WebGL</a> and <a href="#websockets">WebSocket</a>-compatible browser, such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, or Opera
        <br>Internet Explorer is not supported!
</ul>
